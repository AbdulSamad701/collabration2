The Vanishing Room

Elena checked into the old Harborview Hotel late at night. The clerk gave her a brass key engraved with the number 6, telling her it was one of their oldest rooms.

The hallway was dim, and when she unlocked the door, she found a cozy little room with faded wallpaper and a single window overlooking the sea. Exhausted, she collapsed into bed.

But at dawn, when she stepped into the hall, she realized something was wrong. The door behind her no longer had a number. The brass plate was gone.

Confused, she asked the clerk about Room 6. His smile faded.
“Room 6?” he whispered. “That room was sealed shut fifty years ago. A guest vanished in it and was never found.”

Elena’s key was suddenly cold in her hand. She looked down.
The number 6 had vanished from it too.
